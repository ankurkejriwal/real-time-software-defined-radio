---- NOTE FOR MODE 1 ERROR -----
When trying to run mode 1 live we encounter the following error, if we run it a few times it eventually runs but we were not able to resolve this:
Found 1 device(s):

Detached kernel driver

and also its fine in mode 0, so we're not sure if its some optimization issue in mode 1 or something to do with the pi. It also works fine with recorded raw audio files
